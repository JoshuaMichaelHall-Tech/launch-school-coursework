## Triangle Equal Side/Angle Rule

and vica versa.

## Scalene Triangle

## Transversal
A line that cuts or intersects two or more other lines.

## Transversal Rule
If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, and if it is perpendicular to 
one of the lines, it is also perpendicular to the other line. If the transversal 
is not perpendicular to the lines, two groups of equal angles are formed. Half
are large and half are small.

## Scale Factor
When 3 or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, the lengths of the 
corresponding segments of the transversal are proportional.

## X to power of -n 
If n is any real number and X is any real number that is not zero:
X<sup>-n</sup> = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>X<sup>n</sup></sub>
We can write an exponential expression in reciprocal form if we change the 
sign of the exponent.

## Product Theorem for Exponents
If M, N, and X are real numbers and X is not zero, then:
X<sup>M</sup> ⋅ X<sup>N</sup> = X<sup>M+N</sup>
(Therefore, X to the power of M times X to the power of N is equal to X to the 
power of M plus N, not M times N.)

## Power Theorem for Exponents 
If `m` and `n` are real numbers, $(x^m)^n = x^mn$

If the variables are real numbers, $(x^m y^a z^b k^c ...)^n = x^mn y^an z^bn 
k^cn ...$

numbers used to replace the variables.

## What is the Distributive Property in algebra?
The Distributive Property states that for any real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:
- $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
- $(b + c)a = ba + ca$

This property allows you to "distribute" multiplication over addition or 
subtraction. For example:
- $3(x + 5) = 3x + 15$
- $2(3x - 4) = 6x - 8$

The property is essential for expanding expressions, factoring polynomials, 
and solving complex equations by breaking them into simpler components.

## Addition Rule for Equations
If $a = b$, then $a + c = b + c$ for any value of $c$. This means you can add 
the same value to both sides of an equation without changing its solutions.

## Multiplication/Division Rule for Equations
If $a = b$ and $c \neq 0$, then $a \cdot c = b \cdot c$ and $\frac{a}{c} = 
\frac{b}{c}$. You can multiply or divide both sides of an equation by the same 
non-zero value without changing its solutions.

## Equivalent Equations
Equations that have exactly the same solution set. They may look different but 
will always yield the same solution(s) when solved.

## Coefficient of Variable
The numerical factor multiplying a variable. In the term $5x$, the coefficient 
is $5$. Coefficients can be integers, fractions, decimals, or even variables.

## Transposition
Moving a term from one side of an equation to the other by performing the 
opposite operation. For example, in $x + 3 = 7$, transposing the $3$ gives 
$x = 7 - 3$.

## Rule Regarding Obtaining Unique Solution
To obtain a unique solution for a system of linear equations, there must be at 
least as many independent equations as there are unknowns (variables).

## Decimal Fraction
A fraction represented using decimal notation rather than the traditional 
numerator and denominator. Examples: $0.5 = \frac{1}{2}$, 
$0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$.

## Percent
A ratio expressed as a fraction of 100, denoted by the symbol %. For example, 
$25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25$.

## Ratio Form
A comparison of two quantities expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$ or in the 
form $a:b$. Example: The ratio of 3 to 4 can be written as $\frac{3}{4}$ 
or $3:4$.

## Polynomial
An expression consisting of variables and coefficients combined using addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents.
Example: $3x^4 + 2x^2 - 5x + 7$

## Simplenomial
A polynomial with only one term. Also called a monomial.
Examples: $5x^3$, $-7y^2z$, $\frac{1}{2}a^4b^2$

## Polynomial Equation

Example: $2x^3 - 4x + 1 = 3x^2 + 5$

## Rule Graph First Degree Polynomial - Straight Line
The graph of any first-degree polynomial equation (linear equation)
$ax + by + c = 0$ where $a$ and $b$ are not both zero, is always a straight 
line.

## Intercept Slope Method
A method to graph linear equations by finding the $x$-intercept (where the line 
crosses the $x$-axis) and the $y$-intercept (where the line crosses the 
$y$-axis).

## The Diagonals of a Rectangle Have Equal Lengths
In any rectangle, the two diagonals have the same length and bisect each other.
If the rectangle has sides $a$ and $b$, the diagonal length is 
$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

## Pythagorean Theorem
In a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum 
of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
If $a$ and $b$ are legs and $c$ is the hypotenuse, then $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Rule
A mathematical statement that is always true under specified conditions and 
can be used to solve problems or derive other statements.

## Theorem
A mathematical statement that has been proven to be true based on axioms and 
previously established theorems or lemmas.

## If Two Tangents Are Drawn to a Circle From a Point Outside the Circle
If two tangents are drawn to a circle from a point outside the circle, 
the lengths of the tangent segments are equal.

## Denominator-Numerator Same-Quantity Rule
When the same value is added to both the numerator and denominator of a 
fraction, the resulting fraction is not equivalent to the original fraction.
$\frac{a}{b} \neq \frac{a+c}{b+c}$ for $c \neq 0$.

## Inscribed Angle
An angle formed by two chords that intersect on the circle. The measure of an 
inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

## Inscribed Angle That Intercepts a Diameter
An inscribed angle that intercepts a diameter (or semicircle) is always a right 
angle (90°).

## Linear Equation
An equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It can be written in the 
form $ax + by + c = 0$ where $a$ and $b$ are not both zero.

## Slope Intercept Form

and $b$ is the $y$-intercept of the line.

## Magnitude of a Slope
The absolute value of the slope, representing the steepness of a line regardless 
of its direction. For a slope $m$, the magnitude is $|m|$.

## Substitution Axiom
If $a = b$, then $a$ can be replaced by $b$ (or $b$ by $a$) in any expression 
without changing the value of the expression.

## Bisect
To divide something into two equal parts. A line that bisects an angle divides 
it into two equal angles.

## Median
A line segment connecting a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the 
opposite side. Every triangle has three medians, which intersect at the 
centroid.

## Perpendicular Bisector
A line that passes through the midpoint of a line segment and is perpendicular 
to it. All points on this line are equidistant from the endpoints of the 
segment.

## Elimination Method
