# Getting Started - Introduction

## A Brief Python History

- Created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s
- Named after the British comedy group "Monty Python's Flying Circus"
- First public release (version 0.90) in 1991, first production version (1.0) in 1994
- Python 2 support ended in 2020; all developers should now use Python 3
- Python 3 introduced many changes that were incompatible with version 2, leading to slow adoption

## Python's Future

- Python's future seems stable with continued growth and popularity
- Likely no Python version 4 anytime soon due to lessons learned from difficult Python 2 to 3 migration
- Incremental improvements through minor versions (e.g., from 3.9 to 3.10)
- Future changes will likely avoid significant incompatibilities

## Abstraction

- **Abstraction**: Users don't need to know what's happening "under the hood"
- Example: Phone users interact with UI without knowing internal workings
- Programming languages operate at different abstraction levels:
  - User applications (highest level)
  - Python code (higher level)
  - Python interpreter (converts to byte code)
  - Machine code (1s and 0s, lowest level)
- Understanding lower levels of abstraction helps better use higher level tools
- This book teaches Python fundamentals to provide a solid foundation

## Who This Book is For

- Intended for inexperienced or new programmers
- Provides a solid foundation for Python programming
- Experienced programmers may also benefit from reviewing fundamentals
- Guides through common pitfalls beginners face
- Helps develop "muscle memory" for Python syntax
- Software development requires specific temperament: patience, persistence, focus, logic
- Shifts in thinking will occur with practice

## What's Not Covered

- Book focuses on essential information to start programming journey
- Follows Launch School's Mastery Based Learning approach
- Topics omitted include:
  - 3rd Party Libraries (NumPy, Flask, etc.)
  - Asynchronous Programming
  - Object-Oriented Python (covered briefly)
  - Testing
  - Intermediate Language Constructs
  - Unicode and ASCII (mentioned briefly)

## How to Read This Book

- Reading about programming is not the same as writing programs
- "Muscle memory" is crucial for programming 
- Do every exercise to cement basics
- Practice makes coding become second nature
- Focus on the material presented rather than getting distracted by omitted topics
