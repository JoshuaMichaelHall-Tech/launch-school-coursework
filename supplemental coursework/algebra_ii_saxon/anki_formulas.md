## Primitive or Undefined Terms 
Fundamental mathematical terms which are impossible to define exactly. EG point,
curve, line, plane.

## Complimentary Angles
Angles which together form a right angle.

## Supplementary Angles
Angles whicn together form a straight angle.

## Cumulative Property of Real Numbers in Addition
The order of addition does not matter.

## Calculate Circumpherence
pi * diameter

## Irrational Number 
A decimal number requiring an infinite number of digits. IE pi.

## Right Geometric Solid
A geometric solid whose sides are perpendicular to the base.

## Volume of a Right Solid
Area of base times height.

## Prism
A cylindar whose base is a shape whose sides are line segments.

## cylindar
Formed by moving a line segment, called an element, around a closed, flat,
geometric figure. The element must always be parallel to a given line.

## Volume of a Cylindar 
Area of base times perpendicular distance between bases.

## Cone
A solid bounded by a closed, flat base, and the surface formed by line segments
which join all points on the boundary of the base to a fixed point not in the 
plane of the base.

## Cone Axis
Line segment from the center of a cone base to the vertex.

## Pyramid
Cone whose base is a polygon.

## Volume of Cone
1/3 the volume of the cylindar with the same base and height.

## Sphere
Round, 3d shape. Every point on the surface is equidistant from the center.

## Volume of Sphere
2/3 the volume of the cylindar into which the sphere fits. 

## Slant Height 
On a right cylindar cone, the distance from the vertex to any point on the 
perimeter of the base.

## Arc
Part of a circle circumpherence.

## Sector of Circle
Area of a circle enclosed by two radii and the endpoints of an arc.

## Regular Polygon 
A polygon whose angles have equal measures and whose sides have equal lengths.

## Consecutive Vertices
The endpoints of one side of a polygon.

## Consecutive Sides 
Two adjacent sides of a polygon.

## Diagonal of a Polygon
A line segment connecting two non-consecutive vertices.

## Right Triangle
A triangle with 1 90-degree angle.

## Obtuce Triangle
A triangle with 1 >90-degree angle.

## Accute Triangle
A triangle with all angles <90-degrees.

## Sum of all measures of all angles of a triangle.
180 degrees

## Triangle Angle to Side Rule
The greatest angle is always opposite the longest side.

## Triangle Equal Side/Angle Rule
If two angles of a triangle are equal, their opposing sides are also equal
and vica versa.

## Scalene Triangle
Triangle with no equal sides, and therefore, no equal angles.

## Isosceles Triangle
Triangle with 2 equal sides, and therefore, 2 equal angles.

## Equilateral Triangle
Triangle with all equal sides, and therefore, all equal angles.

## Transversal
A line that cuts or intersects two or more other lines.

## Transversal Rule
If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, and if it is perpendicular to 
one of the lines, it is also perpendicular to the other line. If the transversal 
is not perpendicular to the lines, two groups of equal angles are formed. Half
are large and half are small.

## Scale Factor
When 3 or more parallel lines are cut by two transversals, the lengths of the 
corresponding segments of the transversal are proportional.

## X to power of -n 
If n is any real number and X is any real number that is not zero:
X<sup>-n</sup> = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>X<sup>n</sup></sub>
We can write an exponential expression in reciprocal form if we change the 
sign of the exponent.

## Product Theorem for Exponents
If M, N, and X are real numbers and X is not zero, then:
X<sup>M</sup> â‹… X<sup>N</sup> = X<sup>M+N</sup>
(Therefore, X to the power of M times X to the power of N is equal to X to the 
power of M plus N, not M times N.)
